# Hey, I'm Ciaran 👋🏻

<p>I build and scale the data foundations that power multimodal AI models and modern product development. I work end-to-end across data science, engineering, and operations using Python, SQL, and R to deliver analytics, statistical modelling, machine learning, and robust ETL pipelines.</p>

<p>My toolkit includes DBT, Terraform, Docker, Airflow, Dagster, Fivetran, Hightouch, and Census, which I use to create reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient data workflows. I also work with JavaScript and other languages for cross-functional data tasks, and have experience delivering cloud data platforms across AWS, GCP, and Azure.</p>

<p>My focus is on enabling AI, ML, and product teams with the high-quality data necessary to ship impactful products.</p>
