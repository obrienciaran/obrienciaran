<p>I am a data scientist who loves technology and computing. I mainly work with Python (Scikit Learn, Keras, Tensorflow etc.) & R (Caret, Tidyverse, etc.) for data analytics, data visualisation, deep learning, machine learning, and tackling artificial intelligence tasks. </p>

<p>Given my academic background in biological science, I have professional experience and PhD level knowledge within in the fields of radiology and preventative medicine. On top of this medical data facing experience, I more recenttly have been focusing on data science for business, web technology and products, and web user experience. I have worked here with additional languages such as SQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, VB, and JavaScript for data related tasks, as well as having experience in AWS.</p>
